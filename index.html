		<h1>Should we put pineapple on pizza</h1>
		<h2>We should not put pineapple on pizza</h2>
		<p>I don't like pineapple pizza because I think it tastes strange. I like pizza with meat. If put the fruit and meat together on the pizza, I think that is not delicious.

		<p>I think pineapple is good, but if add pineapple to pizza, it not taste good. Because the pineapple is sour and sweet, the meat is usually salty. It would be strange to add these flavors together. I donâ€™t like the taste of this. </p>

		<h2>We should put pineapple on the pizza</h2>
	    <p>I think pineapples should be put in the pizza. First of all, because the unique sweetness of pineapple will make the meat taste more delicious, then the taste of pineapple sour will make people more appetizing. Finally, pineapple is a fruit. If we eat pizza without any fruit, it will be less healthy. High-calorie foods should need some fruits and vegetables to make it better.</p>

 		<p>From my personal point of view, my favorite fruit is pineapple, but if you eat pineapple alone, it will be a bit sour and the taste is not very good. If you eat it with meat, the taste of the pineapple will become very sweet and at the same time Make pizza less greasy, I love pineapple very much. I think there must be a pineapple on the pizza to be a successful pizza. Besides, I think pineapple can be used as an ingredient in any meat.</p>
