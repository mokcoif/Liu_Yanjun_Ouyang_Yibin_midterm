		<h1>Should we put pineapple on pizza</h1>
		<p>I don't like pineapple pizza because I think it tastes strange. I like pizza with meat. If put the fruit and meat together on the pizza, I think that is not delicious.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>I think pineapple is good, but if add pineapple to pizza, it not taste good. Because the pineapple is sour and sweet, the meat is usually salty. It would be strange to add these flavors together. I donâ€™t like the taste of this. </p>
